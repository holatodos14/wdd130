    <p>Hi, everyone. I'm from Peru, Arequipa. It is a city located in the south of Peru, and many people call it Ciudad Blanca because
        many important buildings are constructed with ashlars.

        I am an electrician, plumber, and Majolica veneer master's assistant. I feel so happy to start this
        course with you, I'm so exited to know you and keep working on our studies.
    </p>
