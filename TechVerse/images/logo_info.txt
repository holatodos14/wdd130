This is a case study

Case Study 
"Your friend joined the Church last week and is preparing to do baptisms for the dead for the first time. They ask you to help them better understand why it is important to do baptisms for the dead because God is all-knowing, and He can work it out later."

First, you are going to create a case study like an essay answering this question 'What gospel principles or doctrines are involved in the case study, and how do they help to clarify and give direction in addressing the situation?'. You going to use these references to create the case study.
 1. Scripture: Article of Faith #10
 2. THE FAMILY A PROCLAMATION TO THE WORLD: #7 pharagraph
 3. Talk: “Why Do We Baptize for the Dead?” -Elder D. Todd Christofferson
 4. Talk: “Roots and Branches” -Elder Quentin L. Cook
 5. Talk: “The Hearts of the Children Shall Turn” -Elder David A. Bednar
 7. Talk: “Eternal Families” -President Henry B. Eyring
 
Second, after create the case study you going to answer the next questions.
 1.Discuss what resources you used to address the dilemma and specific things that could be  done to resolve the issue.
 2.Drawing inspiration from the proclamation, scripture block, and talks,
 discuss how these resources might help you help someone else with this same issue.
 3.What advice would you give to others facing this same situation?
